## Project Description

A Swift App to curate your productivity with swipeable music. Using a swipeable user interface, users can demonstrate there musical preferences
without having to interpret them directly - we'll do it for you! The end experience is hours of passive music curated exactly
to what you want to hear. No more excuse to change your playlist while you're working! 

## Protoype Summary

This proof of concept prototype includes the basic swiping and music playing functionality. The machine learning aspect is not implemented. We built the initial swiping functionality based on this [tutorial from Gary Tokman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjQj3KAkkIM&t=967s)

## Presentation

The presentation is available in the repo as presentation.pdf

## Next Steps

The UI is mostly implemented, the next major step is using real music (we used royalty-free music from [Ben Sounds](bensounds.com), 
implementing the machine learning backend to curate the ultimate listening experience.
